With allegations of corruption and incompetence plaguing the state legislature in wake of the EB-5 and Gear Up scandals, Noem cannot simply enjoy a backseat campaign like so many Republican candidates before her. If she is to continue her party's winning streak for the governorship and become the state's first female governor, she must define herself early on and keep Billie Sutton at bay with stances on the issues as equally strong as his own.",

With South Dakotans growing tired of business-as-usual politics in Pierre, Sutton's main campaign focus around reform is likely to resonate with many.
